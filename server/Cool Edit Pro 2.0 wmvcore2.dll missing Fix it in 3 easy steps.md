The solution is to copy and rename an existing file in your system folder. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Go to C:/windows/system32/
2. Copy the file "wmvcore.dll"
3. Paste it in the same folder and rename the copied file to "wmvcore2.dll"
4. Restart your computer
5. MAYBE (maybe not necessary) you have to start cool edit pro 2 with "Windows XP service pack 3" compatibility mode. To do this, right-click on the program shortcut, select Properties, go to Compatibility tab, check the box "Run this program in compatibility mode for:", and choose Windows XP (Service Pack 3) from the drop-down menu.

That's it! You should be able to run Cool Edit Pro 2.0 without any errors. This solution is based on the suggestions from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^4^]. However, please note that this is not an official fix from Microsoft or Adobe, and it may not work for everyone. Use it at your own risk.
  
What is WMVCore2.dll and why is it missing?
 
WMVCore2.dll is a dynamic link library (DLL) file that is part of the Windows Media Format SDK, which provides support for playing and creating Windows Media files. Cool Edit Pro 2.0 uses this file to handle some audio and video editing functions. However, this file is not included in some versions of Windows, such as Windows 7 N or Windows 8 N, which do not have Windows Media Player or other related features installed by default. Therefore, if you have one of these versions of Windows, you may not have WMVCore2.dll in your system folder, and Cool Edit Pro 2.0 will fail to find it.

How does copying and renaming WMVCore.dll solve the problem?
 
WMVCore.dll is another DLL file that is also part of the Windows Media Format SDK, but it is a newer version than WMVCore2.dll. It is usually present in most versions of Windows, even those that do not have Windows Media Player or other related features installed by default. Therefore, by copying and renaming WMVCore.dll to WMVCore2.dll, you are essentially creating a duplicate of the newer file and giving it the name that Cool Edit Pro 2.0 expects to find. This way, Cool Edit Pro 2.0 can load the file and use its functions without any errors.
 
However, this solution is not perfect, as there may be some differences between the two files that could cause some compatibility issues or unexpected behavior. For example, some users have reported that after applying this solution, they could not save their projects in MP3 format. Therefore, it is recommended to use this solution only as a temporary workaround until you can find a more permanent solution.
