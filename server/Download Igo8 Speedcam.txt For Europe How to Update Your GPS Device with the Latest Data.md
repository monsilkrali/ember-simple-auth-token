## Step 3: Copy the speedcam file to your device
 
Connect your iGO navigation device to your computer using a USB cable or a memory card reader. Locate the folder where your iGO software is installed on your device. It should be something like Storage card/igo8 or SD card/igo8. Open the folder and find the subfolder called content. Inside the content folder, find another subfolder called speedcam. If you don't see it, create one. Copy the speedcam.txt file from your computer to the speedcam folder on your device.
 
## Step 4: Restart your device and set the settings
 
Disconnect your device from your computer and restart it. Launch your iGO software and go to Settings > Sound & Warnings > Speed Cameras. Make sure that Enable Speed Camera Warnings is checked and adjust the other settings according to your preferences. You can also choose which types of speedcams you want to be alerted for by selecting or deselecting them from the list.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy your navigation with speedcams
 
Now you are ready to use your iGO navigation device with speedcams. You will see icons of speedcams on the map and hear voice alerts when you approach them. You can also access a list of nearby speedcams by tapping on the map screen and selecting More > Speed Cameras.
 
Note: The speedcam file from POIplaza is updated regularly, so you may want to check their website periodically for new versions. To update your speedcam file, just repeat steps 1 to 4 with the latest file.

## Benefits of using speedcams for iGO navigation
 
Using speedcams for iGO navigation can help you drive more safely and avoid fines and penalties. Speedcams can alert you when you are driving above the speed limit or when you are approaching a traffic light camera, a red light camera, or a school zone. By knowing the locations of these speedcams, you can adjust your speed and driving behavior accordingly and avoid accidents and tickets.
 
## Limitations and risks of using speedcams for iGO navigation
 
While using speedcams for iGO navigation can be useful and convenient, it also has some limitations and risks that you should be aware of. First of all, the speedcam file from POIplaza or any other source may not be 100% accurate or up-to-date. There may be some speedcams that are missing, outdated, or incorrect in the file. Therefore, you should not rely solely on the speedcam file and always follow the road signs and traffic rules. Second, using speedcams for iGO navigation may not be legal in some countries or regions. Some authorities may consider it as a form of radar detection or interference and may confiscate your device or impose a fine. Therefore, you should check the local laws and regulations before using speedcams for iGO navigation in a new area.
